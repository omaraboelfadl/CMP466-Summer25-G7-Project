## 1. Problem Statement and Solution Approach

### Problem Definition
Stock market investment decisions require analyzing multiple factors simultaneously. Traditional approaches rely on human expertise and subjective analysis, which can be inconsistent and emotionally biased. An automated, objective classification system is needed.

### Solution Framework
**Binary Classification System:**
- **Good Investment (1)**: Favorable conditions for investment
- **Bad Investment (0)**: Unfavorable conditions for investment

**Investment Quality Scoring Criteria:**
1. **Price Momentum (30%)**: Stocks showing >5% gain over 30 days
2. **Technical Position (25%)**: Price relationship to moving averages (MA20, MA50)
3. **Risk Assessment (20%)**: Volatility levels (lower is better)
4. **Market Sentiment (15%)**: RSI values in healthy range (30-70)
5. **Liquidity Factor (10%)**: Trading volume above average

**Classification Threshold:** Score â‰¥ 0.6 indicates good investment opportunity

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Feature Engineering

**Technical Indicators Created:**
- **Daily Returns**: (Close - Previous Close) / Previous Close
- **Moving Averages**: MA20 (short-term), MA50 (medium-term)
- **RSI**: 14-period Relative Strength Index for momentum
- **Volatility**: 20-period standard deviation of returns
- **Volume Ratio**: Current vs 20-day average volume
- **Momentum**: 30-day price momentum indicator
- **Binary Signals**: Price above MA20/MA50 indicators

### 3.2 Target Variable Creation

**Weighted Scoring System:**
- **Positive Momentum (30%)**: >5% gain in 30 days
- **Technical Strength (25%)**: Average of price above MA indicators
- **Stability (20%)**: Volatility in bottom 30% of historical range
- **Market Health (15%)**: RSI between 30-70
- **Volume Activity (10%)**: Volume >120% of average

### 3.3 Data Preprocessing

**Pipeline Steps:**
1. **Missing Value Handling**: Forward fill for time series continuity
2. **Infinite Value Treatment**: Replace with median values
3. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization
4. **Temporal Split**: 80/20 train/test split (prevents data leakage)
5. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive data validation

## 4. Machine Learning Algorithms

### 4.1 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
**Approach**: Instance-based learning using similarity measures
**Optimization**: Tested k values [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]
**Best Configuration**: k=5 with Euclidean distance
**Rationale**: Captures local patterns in financial data

### 4.2 Logistic Regression
**Approach**: Linear probabilistic classification
**Optimization**: Regularization parameter C [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]
**Best Configuration**: C=1.0 with L2 regularization
**Advantage**: Interpretable coefficients showing feature importance

### 4.3 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
**Approach**: Maximum margin classification with kernel trick
**Optimization**: 
- Kernels: Linear and RBF (gamma='scale')
- C values: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
- Evaluation: 3-fold CV with F1-weighted scoring
**Selection**: Best configuration based on highest F1 score
**Strength**: Handles non-linear patterns effectively

### 4.4 Decision Tree
**Approach**: Rule-based hierarchical classification
**Optimization**: Grid search over multiple parameters
- max_depth: [3, 5, 7, 10, None]
- min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]
- min_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 4]
- criterion: ['gini', 'entropy']
**Advantage**: Highly interpretable decision rules
